- A layered approach to security. Rather than relying on a single perimeter.
- Slowing the advanced of the attack, if one layer is breached a subsequent layer will take over the defence.

## Layers

1. Physical
   - limited accesss to a data center to only autorized personnel
2. Identity and access
   - multifactor authentication or condition based access
3. Perimiter
   - Network security against DDOS and other large scale attacks, before it can cause denial of service for users.
4. Network
   - Network segmentation and Network access controls
5. Compute
   - securing access to virtual machines, on-premise or in the cloud by closing certain ports
6. Application
   - Ensurance that applications are secure and free of security vulnerabilities
7. Data
   - Manage access to business and costumer data and encryption.
