# Zero Trust Principles

---

- Verify Explicity
  - Authenticate and authorize based on data points
    - User Identity
    - Location
    - Device
    - Service
    - Workload
    - Data Classification
    - Anomalies
  - Least Priviliged Access
    - Limit user access
      - Just in Time (JIT)
      - Just enough access (JEA)
      - Risk-based Adaptive Policies
      - Data protection
  - Assume Breach
    - Segment Acces by:
      - Network
      - Devices
      - Application
    - Use encryption to protect data
    - Use Analytics to get visibility
    - Detect Threats
    - IMprove security

- Six Foundational Pillars
  - In a Zero Trust model, all elements work together to provide end-to-end security.
  - The six elements are:
    - Identities
      - Users
      - Services
      - Devices
        - Follow least privilege access principles.
    - Devices
      - Create a large attack surface
      - Data flow from devices to on-premises workloads and the cloud
      - Monitoring devices for health and compliance is an important aspect of security.
    - Applications
      - The way Data is consumed
      - Discorvering all applications being used
        - Sometimes called Shadow IT
        - Not all applications are managed centrally
      - Pillar inclused manageing Permissions and access
    - Data
      - should be classified, labeled and encrypted based on attributes
      - Security efforts are about protecting data when it leaves devices, applications, infrastructure and networks
    - Infrastructure
      - Wheter on-premise or cloud based, it is a threat vector.
        - to improve security you assess for version, configration and JIT access.
    - Networks
      - Should be segmented, including deeper in-network micro segentation.
      - Real-time threat protection
      - End-to-end encryption, monitroing and analystics shoudl be employed.
